Hi There! I'm a Data Science Practitioner who loves to uncover the hidden facts and meaningful insights from messy data. I come with an extensive experience of working with different technologies including Data Science, building effective Machine Learning Model, running Data Pipelines, Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, building Recommendation Systems, and deploying solutions to the cloud. I love to keep myself busy in gaining new skills and doing freelancing projects and contributing towards Data Science community over the the weekends. I am working towards a role where I can engage with a group of like-minded people who dream to bring revolution in the world with data.
